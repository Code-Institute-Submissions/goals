# Top goal scorers

This application allows you to have a quick oversight of the 15 top goal scorers of the premier league, the ammounts of shots they have had and how many of those shot were on target. The interactive nature of the three bar charts allow you to click on one player and have all of their stats highlight or click on a few players and instantly compare.

 
## UX

This website has been created for football fans without a specific demographic in mind because i want to appeal to all spectrums of the footballing world. I matched the font and color pallets to those used by the premier league offcial designers in order to create a fimiliarity for the user. Because the users age will differ considerable i kept everything simple and clean using chunky bars and number easy for the user to see. I wanted the user to be able to make a quick comparison between the a striker shots and how many of those equate to goals and so i built a bar chart because it a brilliant visiual add. I also wanted the user to be able to instantly and effectively compare one players performance to another and this is achieved within a couple of clicks.



## Features
This project involves three interactive bar charts displaying the top 15 premier league goal scorers; goals, shots and shots on target.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users to achieve click on the players goals scored and see how many shots they have had and how many of those shots were on target.

- feature 2 allows users to click on other players and compare thats statics against each other. 

### Features Left to Implement
- In the future i would like to find and use an external source with an array that freuently updates the goals scored by players as they happen so that the information is always up to date.
- I would also like to redevelope a way of making the application more mobile friendly.
- I would also like to add more charts such as goals assists and minutes played to offer the user an even more in depth story.
## Technologies Used

This project uses:
-HTML to structure the site, 
-CSS to style it, 
-D3 to create some visually stunning charts, 
-DC to let the charts comunicate with one another 
-Javascript to let the user interact from the application. 


## Testing

I tested the application by constantly clicking on every bar on each of the charts and found that when i clicked on the 'shots-on-target' or 'shots' graphs it made it hard to navigate back to the original data which could be extremely frustrating the user. Because of this i implemented a reset button which solved the problem, getting all of the data back to how it was upon loading with one simple click.

I asked friends to test the site and they found it a pleasurable and interesting experience. I ran the code through a validator and found no errors.

There is lots of information being displayed from a vast array of players and because of this it doesnt fit directly on a mobile phone page. To get arround this i could have made the bar chart smaller however i feel this would have made it extremely hard to read the information and click on the chart. I could have also included less players however this removes important data from the user and result in a less informed application which defies the ultimate goal of it. 




## Deployment

I uploaded the app to github where it can be accessed and modified for later use by myself and others working on the project:

This app will need weekly updating by the team as and when more goals are scored by the players.

### Content
I get my goal statics from the BBC Sport website a highly efficient and reliable source https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/top-scorers

### Media
To avoid copyright infringements i was very careful not to use any media as the premier league are very hot on copyright and its almost imposible to get high quality material without permission from players, clubs or the league itself.
